â””â”€â”€ index.css            # Global styles
```

## Integration with HLS Server

This React player is designed to work with the FastAPI HLS server. To use both together:

1. Start the HLS server (Docker or local)
2. Start the React player: `npm start`
3. Upload a video to the HLS server via `/upload`
4. Copy the returned HLS URL to the React player
5. Enjoy seamless video streaming!

## Customization

The player can be easily customized:

- **Styling**: Modify CSS files for custom themes
- **Features**: Add new controls or functionality in the component
- **HLS Settings**: Adjust hls.js configuration in the component

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure your HLS server allows cross-origin requests
2. **Video Won't Play**: Check that the HLS URL is accessible and valid
3. **Mobile Playback**: Some mobile browsers require user interaction before playing

### Debug Mode

Open browser developer tools to see console logs for detailed error information and HLS events.
